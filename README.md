# AI-Powered IoT Smart Greenhouse ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–  

## **Introduction**  
This project is an AI-powered smart greenhouse using **Arduino, ESP8266, and environmental sensors (DHT11, soil moisture, ultrasonic depth sensor)**.  
The system **automatically monitors and adjusts** temperature, humidity, and irrigation based on plant needs.  
It also features a **camera module for plant health detection** and allows remote control via **WiFi**.  

## **Features**  
âœ… **Automated Monitoring:** Controls temperature, humidity, and irrigation.  
âœ… **AI-based Plant Health Detection:** Uses a camera module to detect plant conditions.  
âœ… **IoT Connectivity:** Data transmission via ESP8266 for remote access.  
âœ… **Customizable & Expandable:** Can integrate more sensors and AI models.  

## **Hardware Components**  
- **Arduino** (for processing and control)  
- **ESP8266** (for WiFi connectivity)  
- **DHT11** (temperature & humidity sensor)  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** (to monitor soil condition)  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (to check water level)  
- **Water Pump & Fans** (for irrigation and air circulation)  
- **Camera Module** (for plant health analysis)  

## **How It Works**  
1. Sensors collect environmental data.  
2. AI processes data and detects plant health.  
3. The system adjusts **temperature, humidity, and water** based on needs.  
4. The user can **monitor & control the greenhouse remotely**.
